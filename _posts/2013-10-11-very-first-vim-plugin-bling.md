## The Plugin
Today I wrote my very first vim plugin, and it's awesome. Everybody welcome [vim-bling](https://github.com/ivyl/vim-bling).

Current search result (i.e. the one you just
jumped to with <tt>n</tt>, <tt>N</tt>, <tt>\*</tt> or <tt>#</tt>) is pulsed
with colour.

## See it in action

Blinking color, time and number of *blinks* are customizable. <tt>:help
bling</tt> for details.

## Get the plugin
You can get it on [github](https://github.com/ivyl/vim-bling).

Way](http://learnvimscriptthehardway.stevelosh.com/).

I found out that some guy in [some
video](http://www.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/1o6hd0/oscon_2013_more_instantly_better_vim_damian_conway/)
did something similar.

I also have stumbled upon
[pulse.vim](https://github.com/LStinson/Vim/blob/master/plugin/pulse.vim).

Take a look at my [.vim](https://github.com/ivyl/vim-config) and be inspired.
